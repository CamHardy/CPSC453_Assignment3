Assignment 3

This should compile on most of the CompSci computers, although I had to run that -lGL fix that Scott posted on Piazza

Open up the terminal and type:
make
./boilerplate

Instruction for safe and effective use:
Press 1 for a kettle
Press 2 for a fish
At any time while viewing our exquisite cerulean kettle or luscious ochre fish you can press space to toggle control points.

Press 3 for words
While examining the words, you can press up/down to rotate through fonts, or press left/right to rotate through phrases.
You can also press space to see which lines are linear (red), quadratic (green), and cubic (blue).

You can use the scroll wheel to cause the image or text to move left or right.
If you get seasick, or if you lose sight of the image and begin to despair, press 0 to reset everything.

Note that the side to side scrolling goes waayyyyy out of bounds. I ran out of time to fix that. Sorry.

I got some help from Susant mostly.
